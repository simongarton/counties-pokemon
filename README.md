A live demo is available on [here](https://counties-c84ea.web.app/), hosted on Firebase.

## Discussion points

Commit 0ab03c915c9e0c2b741a6c2f5f99813f018359c8 "Code review, cleanup." is the basic app as expected by the test.
I then added some extra stuff to make it prettier - sprite images and some more stats.
